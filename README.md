# Welcome!

You have found my GitHub profile. I am [Alejandro Puente Castro](https://pdi.udc.es/en/File/Pdi/GF8GK). I work as temporary professor and researcher at [University of A Coruna](https://www.udc.es/en/). 

## About me

BSc. in Computer Science, gained my MSc. in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences and have worked in fields, such as early detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease using Deep Learning techniques or self-quantification. Currently, my research is focused on applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to the coordination of heterogeneous groups of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Bioinformatics.
